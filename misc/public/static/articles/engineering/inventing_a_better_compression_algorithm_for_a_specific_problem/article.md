# Inventing a Better Compression Algorithm for a Specific Problem

**Domain-specific knowledge can lead to dramatically better compression results compared to general-purpose algorithms like `brotli`.**

## What domain are we entwined with for today?

A game of snake. We are only interested that it can be represented as a sequence of coordinates on infinite (not really) integer space, where the first coordinate is the head of a snake.

Each coordinate is a pair of numbers representing a position:

* The first number is the X position (horizontal)
* The second number is the Y position (vertical)

```python
(2, 1)  # means X = 2, Y = 1
```

## Let's take this example to demonstrate typical encoding

Consider this snake on a grid:

```txt
    0 1 2 3 4 5 6
  0 . . . . . . .
  1 . . H ● ● . .
  2 . . . . ● . .
  3 . . . . . . .
  4 . . . . . . .
```

This snake is represented as where H is the head and ● represents body segments:

```python
[(2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2)]
```

But how much memory does it take?

## Sailing to the land of Rusty Crabs

We need to decide on the *first*[^1] representation of this sequence in Rust.

```python
[(2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2)]
```

## Take a top-down approach at decomposing this representation

1. It's a sequence
2. A sequence of pairs
3. A pair of `x` and `y` positions
4. `x` position
5. `y` position

From here we take a bottom-up approach:

### `x` position and `y` position

* No reason for them to take differing amounts of memory
* It must be in the space of both negative and positive numbers, so we have few *built-in* choices:
  * `isize`: pointer-sized signed integer (32-bit on 32-bit systems, 64-bit on 64-bit systems)
    * Type not to be used in this context
  * `i8`: 8-bit signed integer (-128 to 127)
    * Likely too small
  * `i16`: 16-bit signed integer (-32,768 to 32,767)
    * Might suffice, but risky if requirements change
  * `i32`: 32-bit signed integer (-2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647)
    * Sweet spot
  * `i64`: 64-bit signed integer (-9,223,372,036,854,775,808 to 9,223,372,036,854,775,807)
    * Clearly too large

*So choose `i32` for both `x` and `y` positions*

### A pair of `x` and `y` positions

A *pair* is a *product type*[^2] and may be represented:

* As tuple

  ```rust
  let as_tuple: (i32, i32) = (0, 0);
  ```

* As struct

  ```rust
  pub struct Pos {
      pub x: i32,
      pub y: i32,
  }
  ```

What do we choose?

* From the perspective of memory consumption:
  * Both take the same amount of memory
    * For this matter, memory layout[^3] for `struct` does not matter: `#[repr(C)]` or default Rust alignment take the same space

* From the perspective of usability:
  * Tuple

    ```rust
    let pos = (0, 0);
    let x = pos.0; // access by index in the tuple
    let y = pos.1; // access by index in the tuple
    ```

  * Struct

    ```rust
    let pos = Pos { x: 0, y: 0}
    let x = pos.x; // access by attribute name
    let y = pos.y; // access by attribute name
    ```

*`struct` wins from the perspective of usability*, because naming is better than indexing.

### A sequence of pairs

> We don't care about modifications - we care about compression of the whole state

So we won't use mutable sequences like `Vec`, queues, etc.

Let's pick **immutable slices** and be *consistent* to use this data structure all the way.

Example:

```rust
let positions: &[Pos] = [
    Pos { x: 0, y: 0 },
    Pos { x: 1, y: 1 },
    Pos { x: 2, y: 2 },
    Pos { x: 3, y: 3 },
]
.as_slice();
```

---

**So we'll use immutable slices of sequences consisting of pairs of `x` and `y` coordinates represented as `i32` composed in `struct`s named `Pos`.**

### Memory Estimations of Current Representation

An instance of `Pos` size is 2 `i32` sizes. So *2 * 4 bytes = 8 bytes*.

The size of a sequence is proportional to the size of a snake. And after the compression it will remain true as well.

So the task is to find a more compressed *view* than *8 bytes * snake size*.

## How domain knowledge might help to optimize the memory consumption?

Well. Let's look once more at the first example.

```txt
    0 1 2 3 4 5 6
  0 . . . . . . .
  1 . . H ● ● . .
  2 . . . . ● . .
  3 . . . . . . .
  4 . . . . . . .
```

We see that a snake consists of connected points.

If it were to go `Up` it would look like:

```txt
    0 1 2 3 4 5 6
  0 . . H . . . .
  1 . . ● ● ● . .
  2 . . . . . . .
  3 . . . . . . .
  4 . . . . . . .
```

Interesting, so `Up` is a direction. Something that seems to have a place in **our domain**.

Let's define a sum type[^4] - an enum in Rust:

```rust
pub enum Direction {
    Up,
    Down,
    Left,
    Right,
}
```

Could we define a snake just in terms of directions? No.

But, if we keep the head (or tail) of the snake as a starting point, we could define the rest of the snake as a sequence of directions.

And what's interesting about `Direction` is that there are *only* 4 choices to pick from. It screams - here's our optimization.

So how many *bits* do we need to encode a `Direction`?

```txt
⌈log₂(n)⌉

where:
- n = number of possible values
- ⌈ ⌉ = ceiling function (round up to nearest integer)
```

So for `Direction`, for 4 choices: bits needed = ⌈log₂(4)⌉ = ⌈2⌉ = **2 bits**.

Let's implement both encode and decode functions on `Direction`:

```rust
impl Direction {
    pub fn encode(&self) -> u8 {
        match self {
            Self::Up => 0b00,
            Self::Down => 0b01,
            Self::Left => 0b10,
            Self::Right => 0b11,
        }
    }

    pub fn decode(value: u8) -> Option<Self> {
        match value {
            0b00 => Some(Self::Up),
            0b01 => Some(Self::Down),
            0b10 => Some(Self::Left),
            0b11 => Some(Self::Right),
            _ => None,
        }
    }
}
```

We use a `u8` since it's a built-in type and there isn't a `u2` built-in. Since it will act as an intermediary value, it's ok.

Back to this example:

```txt
    0 1 2 3 4 5 6
  0 . . . . . . .
  1 . . H ● ● . .
  2 . . . . ● . .
  3 . . . . . . .
  4 . . . . . . .
```

How do we view a snake in terms of a starting point and consequent directions?

```rust
let starting_position: Pos = Pos { x: 2, y: 1 };
let consequent_directions =
    [Direction::Right, Direction::Right, Direction::Down].as_slice();
```

So compared to the previous representation which took *8 bytes * 4 = 32 bytes*, this one takes *8 bytes + 2 bits \* 3 = 8.75 bytes*.

And the longer a snake - the more beneficial such optimization, since the starting point is the most expensive.

## Let's define our custom packing format in terms of packing and unpacking functions

There's no good reason to pack the starting point:

* Less reusable, because a starting point can take variable size, here we chose `i32`
* Coupling of compressible (`Direction`) and uncompressible (`Pos`) data

***The purpose of this article is more to learn to think about problems and solve them than to use bit operations.***

```rust
type DirectionsInLastByte = u8;

// packs a sequence of directions into a sequence of bytes
//
// each Direction is encoded using 2 bits because there are 4 values
// 4 directions can be encoded in 1 byte
//
// since the last partition of directions can contain 1 to 4 values,
// the serializer pads such byte with zeroes
//
// returns a pair of packed values and how many directions are in the last byte
pub fn pack_values(directions: &[Direction]) -> (Vec<u8>, DirectionsInLastByte) {
    let mut result = Vec::with_capacity((directions.len() + 3) / 4);

    for chunk in directions.chunks(4) {
        // start with empty byte
        let mut byte = 0u8;

        for dir in chunk {
            // move to left, leaving 2 bits of space
            byte <<= 2;
            // use bit OR to append 2 bit value to the end
            byte |= dir.encode();
        }

        // pad zeroes when chunk length is less than 4
        byte <<= 2 * (4 - chunk.len());

        result.push(byte);
    }

    let directions_in_last_byte = {
        let remainder = (directions.len() % 4) as u8;
        if remainder == 0 && !directions.is_empty() {
            4
        } else {
            remainder
        }
    };

    (result, directions_in_last_byte)
}

pub fn unpack_values(
    packed: &[u8],
    directions_in_last_byte: DirectionsInLastByte,
) -> Vec<Direction> {
    let mut result = Vec::with_capacity(packed.len() * 4);

    fn decode_byte(byte: u8, contains: u8) -> Vec<Direction> {
        let mut result = vec![];

        assert!(contains >= 1);
        assert!(contains <= 4);

        for i in 0..contains {
            let mask_shift = 6 - (2 * i);

            let mask = 0b11 << mask_shift;

            // extract bits using:
            // shifted 0b11 with & (removing bits to the left and right of the mask),
            // then bit shift to the right by the mask shift size,
            // leaving you with a byte not exceeding decimal value 3 (2 bits)
            let dir_encoded = (byte & mask) >> mask_shift;
            result.push(Direction::decode(dir_encoded).expect("to be packed properly"));
        }

        result
    }

    for (i, byte) in packed.into_iter().enumerate() {
        let contains = if i == packed.len() - 1 {
            directions_in_last_byte
        } else {
            4u8
        };

        result.extend(decode_byte(*byte, contains));
    }

    result
}

#[cfg(test)]
mod tests {
    use super::*;

    #[test]
    fn test_pack_unpack_values() {
        let (packed, values_in_last_byte) =
            pack_values(&[Direction::Right, Direction::Right, Direction::Down]);
        assert_eq!(packed, vec![0b11_11_01_00]);

        assert_eq!(
            unpack_values(&vec![0b11_11_01_00], values_in_last_byte),
            vec![Direction::Right, Direction::Right, Direction::Down]
        );
    }
}
```

### Having all this we can

* Encode a snake having 2 values:
  * Starting position
  * Consequent directions

* Decode a snake having 3 values:
  * Starting position
  * What the packing function returned:
    * Packed consequent directions (where the optimization lies)
    * How many directions are in the last byte of packed directions

## Our custom compression format is done

And it's battle-tested in [snake](https://github.com/phantie/snake)

## So let's plot functions depending on snake size (growth) for memory consumption with and without our custom compression

`k` is a length (growth) of a snake

A function without compression:

```txt
y = 8 bytes * k
```

![uncompressed](/static/articles/engineering/inventing_a_better_compression_algorithm_for_a_specific_problem/images/uncompressed.jpg)

A function with compression:

```txt
y = max(0, sign(k)) * 8 bytes + ceil((k - 1) / 4) bytes + 1 byte
```

![compressed](/static/articles/engineering/inventing_a_better_compression_algorithm_for_a_specific_problem/images/compressed.jpg)

From this we can see that memory consumption with `k=20` is:

* *160 bytes* without compression
* *14 bytes* with compression (and benefits are more significant with larger `k`)

## Conclusion

Rarely do you solve really interesting problems (or challenge yourself this way), but coming up with your own compression algorithm is in the space of *interesting problems*. It brings a lot of satisfaction when it works. Especially as part of a larger process, that you can't even believe it if it works from the first try.
