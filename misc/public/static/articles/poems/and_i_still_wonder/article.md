# And I still wonder

```txt
Look at these hands
They are trembling

Your tears on my lips
My broken promise

I know how to speak
Apparently not under morning rain

Peace found
Only to be lost

Envious eyes around
Should have known better

And I still wonder

Perhaps Iâ€™m not too old
To trust again
```
