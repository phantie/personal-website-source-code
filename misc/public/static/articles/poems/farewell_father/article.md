# Farewell, Father

```txt
He will never smile at his daughter and his wife again.
Won't feel their love and touch.
Won't tell about his day at work.
Won't open a beer and enjoy a day's end.
Won't play ball with his brother, daughter and dog, that he loved more than I ever could.
Won't play chess and win every time against me.
Won't fix a door's creak or build a house.
Won't have a conversation with me that he told me I won't remember.
Won't see his grandchildren or the war's end.
Won't be proven wrong or right.
Won't get the ending he deserved.
```

August 7th, 2023 — the day we learned that father had died defending our country.
