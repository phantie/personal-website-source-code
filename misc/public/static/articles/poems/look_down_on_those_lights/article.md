# Look down on those lights

```txt
Look down on those lights.

Those hateful lights,
I turn my gaze away from.
Those screaming lights,
Leaving white spots on my eyes.
Those dead lights,
Devoid of any warmth.

Let a smile of this tired girl brighten this evening,
Fading into night.
Let darkness remind me of beauty of these white flowers,
This scarce and sacred beauty.

Please be, this light that glows over the bench I'm sitting on,
When my feet are numb.
Please be, those distant blinking lights on this same shore,
When I feel alone.

I praise the lights that guide me home.
I know it's my feet that hurt,
But I grab my head.

I struggle through darkness.
I care no more,
But I wish for a glimpse of light.

I'm at home.
Thankful for this gentle light.
And this place, where my feet rest.
