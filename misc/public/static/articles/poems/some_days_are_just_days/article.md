# Some days are just days

Some days are just days

Vain pursuits of escape
Boring as death slideshows
Glimpses of countless stories

Retreating tears of sorrow
Taunting wine scents
Lingering summers of young heart

Dim spans of homeward trail
Inevitably ending shore walks
Loose ends of blue shallow thoughts
```
