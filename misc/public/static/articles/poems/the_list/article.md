# The List

```txt
I am to live.
For I am blessed.
I am to better.
For I am worse.
I am to forgive.
For I am flawed.
I am to laugh.
For I am absurd.
I am to think.
For I am chained.

I am to hold.
For my hands were slippery.
I am to write.
For my pencil tips kept breaking.
I am to sing.
For I was deaf.
I am to help.
For I was helpless.
I am to breath.
For I ran through the smoking fields.

I am to love.
For good.
