# When days become shorter

A mere few birthdays I know.

Half of my life I know my best friend.
When his?
When mine?
Recently we agreed - it does not matter to know.

Now, when days start becoming shorter.
I remembered.

25 years old she is today.
On June 25th.
Year '25.
I'd regret not writing about her today.

I have no memory of 1st grade.

Just when 2nd grade started.
All of a sudden.
Every second counted.
Mom is leaving.
And I must catch up with her.

"I want to sit with someone else."
Mom heard.

Given choices.
I picked.

A calm sea seamlessly melting into cerulean sky.
Her eyes are.
A calm sea seamlessly melting into cerulean sky.

They distracted me so much.
And something distracted her.

Later exiled.

I often contemplated them.
And they giggled at me.

Back then we were too young to know.
What it was.
What it will be.
