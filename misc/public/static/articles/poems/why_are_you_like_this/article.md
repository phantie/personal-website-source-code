# Why are you like this?

```txt
Just overestimated myself.
This time.
Best lessons leave scars,
But of these wounds, only words will last.

No, I've done it before.
I'll try again.
With stars cheering for me,
Blinded and aimed for heights.

For myself?
Oh, I do.
At dusks and dawns,
More so I fear myself.

Well, it matters.
Though dust, struggle and pain.
I pity shadows,
Despaired over their owners.

The leaves hugging themselves, as the wind seeking a place to rest.
The bird orchestra, thankful for fruits not yet rotten.
The raindrops weeping for voiceless generous land.
Why are you like this?
